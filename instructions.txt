1. Download and install nodejs LTS version. I used v16.20.1. 
Link: https://nodejs.org/download/release/v16.20.1/ -> Pick as per your OS

2. After installation completes open a terminal window and check installation by passing the following commands in terminal:

i. npm -v
ii. node -v

3. If step shows results for both the commands. Then install yarn by typing the following command in terminal.

npm install --global yarn

4. Restart the terminal and open the folder location where you have extracted the source code (along with this file).

5. Ensure docuSign folder is opened in terminal and type the following command in terminal.

yarn install
